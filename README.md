# BLE Sensor Simulation Project

## 📚 About This Project

This project was developed by **Utku Enes Önmaz** as part of the Borda Academy Embedded Systems Developer Case.

The goal was to simulate a BLE-enabled embedded system that collects sensor data (temperature, humidity, CO₂), processes it, and broadcasts it in a meaningful and compact BLE advertisement packet.

As a student and developer, I approached this case as if I was building the base logic of a real-world IoT device, even without physical sensors. All data is simulated but the logic is real: from data collection and filtering, to buffer management and BLE packet encoding.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. 📏 Collects 5 recent readings for each sensor (simulated)
2. 🧮 Calculates the **median** to smooth out sudden jumps
3. 🔁 Stores the medians in a circular buffer (like a small notepad)
4. 📊 Computes **stats** (median, min, max, std dev) over all recent values
5. 🎯 Converts each stat into a short 2-byte format (BLE likes things small)
6. 📡 Packs them into a BLE advertisement packet
7. 🔁 Repeats every 30 seconds

The system runs on a Linux machine with Bluetooth tools (`hcitool`, `hciconfig`), and you can monitor the broadcast using apps like **LightBlue** on your phone.

This project helped me understand how embedded systems manage real-time data, how buffers and encoding work, and how even limited BLE packets can carry rich information if structured wisely.
